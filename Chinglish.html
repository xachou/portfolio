                        As a practitioner with strong curiosity, I have tried a lot of possible English Learning methods created or concluded by influentiafl teachers as well as different vocabulary learning Apps. The poor outcomes makes me realize the defects in these applications. It’s easy for students to feel vapid and fatigue in a long run preparation under great pressure. Thus, I ask myself, how to help students to memorize thousands new words in a more efficient and intriguing process?

                        In most cases, vocabulary learning habits of Chinese students were developed by their teachers instead of by themselves. Plus the highly stressed preparation atmosphere before Gaokao. Students would lose their motivation in continuously expanding vocabulary after entering into a university as they used to do.

                        Student's time is pretty dispersive, so it is difficult to strictly follow the <strong>The Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve</strong>.
                        Most of us has experienced the problem that missed the review requirement of Apps for one day or even longer. The apps  asked us to review all of the words we missed in one time.
                        The congestion of old words combined with the new learned words  causes resistance for students to
                    </p>

                        The Red(Unknown)-Yellow(Not Sure)-Green(Unfamiliar) (RYG) system is aim to solve this problem. Students can restart at the place the leave several days before.Or, if he or she is preparing for a challenging test, students can review several times in one day based on their personal needs.
                        <br>
                        For example, review 10 green words one time, he or she also need to review 20 yellow words and 30 red words. The proportion can be resized by themselves.

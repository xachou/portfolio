                        Having been engaged in data visualization and interactive design for three months,
                        I took full participation in the project development process as a UX designer and Front End Developer.

                        After obtaining relevant data, I determined the product orientation to improve public’s awareness of pollution issues
                        by using User-Centered Design methodology. Through a matching and screening between users’ demand and data features,
                        I divided different users’ demand for data into three types. I also used my sketches to present disparate possibilities
                        of interactive interfaces, which helped the team reach consensus in just one discussion.
                        Moreover, I set good preparation for product development by drawing frameworks through AxureRP
                        and thus developer could choose suitable visualized charts and designer could create visual communication of interface accordingly.
                        The clear orientation and work division I made has enabled us to finish the product development in just three weeks.

                    <p>
                        The average PM2.5 concentration has reached 102μg/m3 in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region with a population of 130 million, and this is just the beginning of the four-month heating season with frequent hazy days in North China, said Luo Yi, director of Department of Environmental Monitoring, Ministry of Environmental Protection, NOV 2016.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Data from World Health Organization (WHO) showed the safe level of PM2.5 was 10μg/m3. China adopted the widest PM2.5 limits of WHO as its standards: yearly average PM2.5 concentration was 35μg/m3 and daily average PM2.5 concentration was 75μg/m3.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It was revealed that death risk began to increase if PM2.5 concentration stayed higher than 10μg/m3. For every increase of 10μg/m3 in PM2.5, total death risk increased by 4%, death risk caused by heart and lung diseases rose by 6% and death risk caused by lung cancer grew by 8%. Analyzing such data, we can find it evident that our current environment is not suitable for human beings to live in at all.

                        Invalid data and abnormal data were almost removed after I cleansed the original data by Excel. The original data had some noise such as incomplete data set, incompatible formats, and information deficiency. The data cleansing cut the data set by 15%. In order to satisfy specific users’ requirements (the comparison between economy and pollution), I collected the GDP development data of Shandong Province between 2015 and 2016 later on.

                        The data set involved 1366 pollutional enterprises from in Jiangsu Province and Shandong Province. They came from transportation industry, equipment manufacturing industry, power plant, textile industry, sewage treatment industry, chemical production industry, etc. Besides, the data were collected in 186 official pollution monitoring stations and 17 sewage monitoring stations.

Furthermore, by AxureRP, I drew a wireframe diagram that served as a target for the programmers to focus on developing visual diagrams and provided a foundation based which the designers designed the visual system.

                        One of data visualization’s advantages, “vivid”, was presented when the pollutional situation
                        and economic development were cross-compared. In December, Qingdao City, with a GDP value of CNY 77.5 billion,
                        had 81 pollutional enterprises, while Zibo City with a population of 3 million and a GDP value
                        of CNY 33.4 billion is the place in which 108 pollutional enterprises are located in. It’s evident
                        that pollutional enterprises are intensively located and the pollution degree is severe in the northwest of Shandong Province.

                        Through data comparison in industrial structure, we could recognize central and western cities’ dependence on
                        secondary industry and the development of eastern coastal cities in tertiary industry such as Qingdao.
                        The above was clearly pictured by visual diagrams. Policies concerning economic structure adjustment
                        and pollution control remain to be thought over and optimized by the government.
